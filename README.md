# procedural-php-cms
PHP_CMS is a CMS built with procedural PHP and MySQLi.

The project is based on the courses of two Udemy instructors, Edwin Diaz and Dave Hollingworth, and LinkedIn instructor Kevin Skoglund.

It is a mashup which seeks to demonstrate my implementation of procedural PHP and MySQLi.

This project does NOT include Diaz's special features sections, nor does it include the section on nested resources from Skoglund's course. 
There is much room for improvement. However, it does include sections for posts, categories and comments.

It uses Bootstrap 3.3.7, for both front and backend. I chose to use AdminLTE version 2.4.2 which works well with Bootstrap 3. Besides, I like it.

The Bootstrap datepicker, which comes with AdminLTE v-2.4.2, is included.

Also, the static homepage is not "responsive".
